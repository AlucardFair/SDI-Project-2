			<p>For designing and developing themes for multiple BlackBerry devices, you will need a lot of resources. For this, we'll start with the three most popular devices. The BlackBerry Bold 9700, BlackBerry Storm 2 9550 and the BlackBerry Curve 9300. Wallpaper and Icon resolutions will be our focus. The screen (wallpaper) resolution for the BlackBerry Bold 9700 is 480px by 320px. The BlackBerry Storm 2 9550's screen resolution is 320px by 480px. And the screen resolution for the BlackBerry Curve 9300 is 320px by 240px. For the icon resolution, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 is 80px by 80px. The BlackBerry Storm 2 9550's icon resolution is 73px by 73px. And the BlackBerry Curve 9300's icon resolution is 52px by 50 px. You will need to use these exact resolutions to properly export and install your theme.</p>
			<p>BlackBerry themes are a great way to customize your device, much like you would find for a Windows machine and even some Android powered phones.</p>
